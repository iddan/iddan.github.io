description: Lead the building of a Chrome extension and commercial plugin, two
  React.js applications, a node.js based messenger bot, and 3 sites. I took an

  them by myself (from scratch to code). As part of the work, I regularly used
  tools like Webpack, Sass, Babel, Yarn & npm, MongoDB, Google Cloud Platform,
  GitHub, Atom, Illustrator, and Photoshop.
